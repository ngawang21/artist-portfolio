# Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying the enhanced artist portfolio website with full e-commerce functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, you need to set up accounts with the following free services:

1. **Netlify** (already set up)
   - Hosting and serverless functions
   - https://www.netlify.com

2. **Mollie** (already set up)
   - Payment processing
   - https://www.mollie.com

3. **Resend** (new)
   - Email delivery service
   - https://resend.com
   - Free tier: 3,000 emails/month

4. **GitHub** (already set up)
   - Code repository and CMS backend
   - https://github.com

## Step 1: Set Up Resend

1. Go to https://resend.com and create a free account
2. Verify your email address
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)
6. Add your domain or use the default sending domain

## Step 2: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Set the following:
   - **Token name**: Artist Portfolio CMS
   - **Expiration**: 1 year (or custom)
   - **Repository access**: Only select repositories → ngawang21/artist-portfolio
   - **Permissions**:
     - Contents: Read and write
     - Metadata: Read-only
4. Generate token and copy it (starts with `ghp_`)

## Step 3: Configure Netlify Environment Variables

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site (kunart.netlify.app)
3. Go to Site settings → Environment variables
4. Add the following variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Example |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `MOLLIE_API_KEY` | Your Mollie API key | `test_xxxxx` (test mode) or `live_xxxxx` (production) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Your Resend API key | `re_xxxxx` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Your GitHub personal access token | `ghp_xxxxx` |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Repository path | `ngawang21/artist-portfolio` |
| `ARTIST_EMAIL` | Artist email address | `your-email@example.com` |
| `ARTIST_NAME` | Artist name | `Dempa Tsang Kunga` |
| `SITE_URL` | Production URL | `https://kunart.netlify.app` |

**Important**: Make sure to use **test mode** for Mollie initially (`test_xxxxx`). Switch to live mode only after testing.

## Step 4: Update Resend Email Settings

For production use, you need to verify your sending domain:

1. Go to Resend dashboard → Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `kunart.netlify.app`)
3. Add the DNS records provided by Resend to your domain settings
4. Wait for verification (usually a few minutes)
5. Update `ARTIST_EMAIL` in Netlify to use your verified domain

**For testing**: You can use the default Resend sandbox domain.

## Step 5: Deploy to Netlify

The site is already connected to GitHub and will auto-deploy on push. To trigger a deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add e-commerce features"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically:
1. Build the Astro site
2. Deploy static files
3. Deploy Netlify Functions

## Step 6: Test the Workflow

### Testing with Mollie Test Mode

1. Visit your gallery page
2. Click "Buy Now" on any artwork
3. Fill in the checkout form with test data:
   - Name: Test Customer
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Phone: +33 6 12 34 56 78
4. Click "Proceed to Payment"
5. You'll be redirected to Mollie's test checkout
6. Use one of Mollie's test payment methods:
   - Credit Card: Use test card number `5555 5555 5555 4444`
   - iDEAL: Select any test bank and complete the flow
7. After successful payment, you should:
   - Be redirected to the success page
   - Receive a confirmation email with invoice
   - Artist receives notification email with invoice
   - Artwork is marked as sold in CMS

### Verify Each Step

1. **Checkout Page**
   - EN: `https://kunart.netlify.app/checkout/weeping-willow`
   - FR: `https://kunart.netlify.app/fr/checkout/weeping-willow`

2. **Payment Creation**
   - Check Netlify Functions logs for `create-payment`
   - Should show successful payment creation

3. **Webhook Processing**
   - Check Netlify Functions logs for `payment-webhook`
   - Should show:
     - Payment verified
     - Invoice generated
     - Emails sent
     - Artwork marked as sold

4. **Email Delivery**
   - Check Resend dashboard for email delivery status
   - Verify emails received in inbox

5. **CMS Update**
   - Check GitHub repository commits
   - Should see:
     - Invoice counter updated
     - Invoice PDF added to `/invoices/`
     - Artwork JSON updated with `sold: true`

6. **Gallery Update**
   - After Netlify rebuilds (automatic), check gallery
   - Sold artwork should show "Sold" overlay
   - Buy button should be hidden

## Step 7: Switch to Production Mode

Once testing is complete and everything works:

1. Go to Mollie dashboard
2. Complete business verification (if not already done)
3. Get your **live** API key
4. Update `MOLLIE_API_KEY` in Netlify environment variables
5. Trigger a new deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Creation Fails

**Symptoms**: Error on checkout page after clicking "Proceed to Payment"

**Solutions**:
- Check Netlify Functions logs
- Verify `MOLLIE_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Ensure Mollie account is active
- Check that artwork price and title are being passed correctly

### Webhook Not Triggered

**Symptoms**: Payment succeeds but no email received, artwork not marked as sold

**Solutions**:
- Check Mollie dashboard → Payments → Webhooks
- Verify webhook URL is correct: `https://kunart.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/payment-webhook`
- Check Netlify Functions logs for errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set

### Emails Not Sent

**Symptoms**: Webhook processes but emails not received

**Solutions**:
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is correct
- Check spam folder
- Verify sender domain is verified in Resend
- Check Netlify Functions logs for email errors

### Artwork Not Marked as Sold

**Symptoms**: Payment succeeds, emails sent, but artwork still shows as available

**Solutions**:
- Check `GITHUB_TOKEN` has write permissions
- Verify `GITHUB_REPO` is correct
- Check GitHub API rate limits
- Check Netlify Functions logs for GitHub API errors
- Manually trigger a Netlify rebuild

### Invoice Not Generated

**Symptoms**: Emails sent but no invoice attached

**Solutions**:
- Check Netlify Functions logs for PDF generation errors
- Verify invoice counter file exists in `/data/invoice-counter.json`
- Check that artwork data is complete (year, dimensions, price)

## Monitoring

### Netlify Functions Logs

View real-time logs:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to Functions tab
4. Click on a function to view logs

### Resend Email Logs

View email delivery status:
1. Go to Resend dashboard
2. Click on "Emails" tab
3. View delivery status for each email

### Mollie Payment Logs

View payment history:
1. Go to Mollie dashboard
2. Click on "Payments" tab
3. View all payment transactions

### GitHub Commits

View CMS updates:
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Check commit history
3. Verify invoice counter updates
4. Check artwork status updates

## Backup and Recovery

### Invoice Counter

The invoice counter is stored in `/data/invoice-counter.json`. If it gets corrupted:

1. Check the last invoice number in `/invoices/` directory
2. Manually update `/data/invoice-counter.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "lastInvoiceNumber": 5,
     "lastUpdated": "2024-10-28T12:00:00Z"
   }
   ```
3. Commit and push

### Artwork Status

If an artwork is incorrectly marked as sold:

1. Go to Decap CMS admin panel: `https://kunart.netlify.app/admin`
2. Find the artwork
3. Uncheck "Sold" checkbox
4. Save

Or manually edit the JSON file in GitHub.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to the repository
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
3. **Rotate API keys** periodically
4. **Monitor webhook logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Use Mollie test mode** until fully tested
6. **Verify webhook signatures** (already implemented)
7. **Validate all user inputs** (already implemented)

## Performance Optimization

The current implementation is optimized for the free tier limits:

- **Netlify Functions**: 125,000 requests/month
  - Each sale = 2 function calls (create-payment + webhook)
  - Can handle ~62,000 sales/month (far exceeds expected volume)

- **Resend**: 3,000 emails/month
  - Each sale = 2 emails (buyer + artist)
  - Can handle 1,500 sales/month

- **GitHub API**: 5,000 requests/hour
  - Each sale = ~3 API calls
  - Can handle 1,666 sales/hour

All services are well within free tier limits for a small art gallery.

## Support
